Hi all,
Below is the agenda for the POC demo:

To showcase:

   1. POC demo automation framework.
   2. The automation framework tech stack comprises:
   a. Maven build-in tool
   b. Page Object Model design pattern
   c. Appium Library
   d. Java 8
   e. TestNG framework
   f. Allure Reporting library
   g. Logs - log4j and console logs
   3. Parallel execution of scenarios on Android (Google Chrome) and iOS
   (Safari) devices + browsers.
   4. Scenarios that have been automated:
   a. *Scenario 1:* Landing Page UI
   b. *Scenario 2:* Checkout Page UI
   c. *Scenario 3:* Full Bill + tip with card payment
   5. Validations and verifications as mentioned in the test scenarios.

Implementation of:

   1. Continuous Integration using Jenkins/ Azure DevOps
   2. Source code management tool - GitHub
   3. Customized Extent reports.
   4. Execution Reports Status Integration with Slack
   5. Additional parallel execution combinations of OS + Browsers
   6. Test cases execution on cloud farm devices.
   7. Documents explaining and detailing the Framework
   8. Pass/ Fail screenshots of steps in logs.
   9. A more optimized code and page object model with every implementation
   is behind the pages.
   10. Single code for executing scenarios on iOS and Android platforms.
